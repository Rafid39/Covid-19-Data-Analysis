COVID-19 Data Analysis (January 2020 - July 2020)
Project Overview
This project analyzes global and country-level COVID-19 data spanning from January 2020 to July 2020. The objective was to uncover trends, patterns, and insights regarding the pandemic's impact using a combination of tools and techniques. The analysis addresses key questions related to cases, recoveries, deaths, and other critical metrics.
Tools Used
•	Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning and preparation.
•	Python: Advanced data cleaning and handling of null and duplicate values.
•	MySQL: Analytical querying to identify trends and generate insights.
•	Power BI: Interactive dashboard creation for visualization.
Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning
•	The dataset contained numerous duplicate and null entries.
•	Python and Excel were used to:
1.	Identify and handle missing values by inserting placeholders (e.g., "NULL").
2.	Remove duplicates and ensure consistency.
3.	Prepare the data for analysis by standardizing formats.
2. Data Analysis Using MySQL
•	A dedicated MySQL database named COVID was created to store the cleaned data.
•	Analytical queries were executed to answer questions such as:
1.	Global Trends: Countries with the highest total cases and recoveries.
2.	Monthly Case Growth: Trends in confirmed cases over the seven-month period.
3.	Recovery and Critical Ratios: Top-performing countries in terms of recovery rates.
4.	Continental Insights: Distribution of cases across continents.
5.	Key Patterns:
	Highest total cases: USA.
	Highest cases per million: Qatar.
	Top recovery rates: Dominica, Ghana, and Holy See.
	Week 30 (late July) had the highest confirmed cases globally.
3. Visualization Using Power BI
•	The analysis culminated in an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights:
1.	Countries with the highest and lowest recovery rates.
2.	Continents and countries with the most and least cases.
3.	Comparative visualizations of deaths, recoveries, and active cases.
•	This dashboard brings the data to life, making trends and insights accessible at a glance.
4. Results Export
•	Results from MySQL queries were exported to an Excel file for further processing and documentation. This Excel file is included in the repository for reference.
Key Insights
•	USA led in total cases, recoveries, and deaths during the analysis period.
•	Qatar reported the highest cases per million population.
•	The highest recovery rates were observed in Dominica, Ghana, and Holy See.
•	Week 30 of 2020 recorded the most confirmed cases globally.
•	Among continents, North America had the highest total cases, while Australia had the lowest.
